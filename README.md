# EEP153-P4
This project analyzes nutritional adequacy across Ethiopia, with a specific focus on addressing calcium deficiency, a critical public health issue linked to malnutrition, stunted growth, and complications during pregnancy. Our analysis examines both the national population and three key regions: Tigray, Oromia, and Amhara. We evaluate and model three policy interventions aimed at reducing calcium deficiency and assess their cost-effectiveness to inform data-driven decision-making. 

The key file to be reviewed is P4-EthiopiaCodeReview, it contains the bulk of our regression work, describes models that simulate changes in nutritional adequacy based on price reduction for specific goods and nutritional expenditure increases. Histograms are plotted to facilitate visualizing these changes and their impacts. The final cell generates a comparison of nutritional adequacy based on a range of policies. Please be aware that the code does take a while to run all scenario calculations.

To execute the unit tests, please download the zip files. Then, run the tests using a command like `pytest test5.py -v` in your terminal.
